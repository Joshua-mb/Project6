## Notes

**Challenges encountered:**

- The main challenge was troubleshooting a crash when navigating to the detail screen. The issue was caused by an incorrect segue identifier, which prevented data from being passed to the Detail View Controller. Double-checking the storyboard segue identifier and adding print statements helped debug and resolve the issue quickly.
